## Inspiration
It's inspired by the note-managing method mentioned in the book named "How to take smart notes: one simple technique to boost writing, learning and thinking".
- The author introduced two slip-note boxes, one is for storing reference notes, another is for keeping ideas, thoughts or views. Only write one point in each note, and you can add sequencial note after one.
- When you have ideas on one reference note, create a thought note related to it by adding the reference note's index in thought note, so that you can trace back easily whenever you want.
- Considering that you might have more than one thread of thought on a reference note, and note all your thoughts are in the same topic or fit into one context. Therefore, all notes are managed by index rather than topics.
- After creating abundant thought notes, you might want to sort all of them out by writing a long article, specifically focusing on a topic. With all your thoughts recorded and their reference information, it will be easier to structure your writing.

#### ** The main purpose for this app is to apply what I've learned and hone my frontend and backend development skills. The current design is not a good solution for the problem, but I will keep updating the user experience and try to bring it alive.
